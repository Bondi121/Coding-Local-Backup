          This is my portfolio. I'm an aspiring data analyst and I use this page
          to share my Colombian travel experiences and as a portfolio to provide
          stats and visualizations about Colombia.

        <h2>Resume</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a Python developer and creative problem-solver with a life-long
          passion for and fascination with solving complex challenges,
          especially those requiring technological solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
          After starting my career in customer-oriented roles in various
          technical settings, including sports betting companies and university
          research environments, I decided to tap into my more technical side
          and pursue a career in Python development.
        </p>
        <p>
          Between completing the Thinking and Creating with Code course at
          EPFL and working on two major coding projects in my free time, I’ve
          continuously developed my web development, frontend programming, and
          backend development skills, as well as my expertise in several areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>SQL</li>
          <li>Pandas</li>
          <li>Matplotlib</li>
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Flask</li>
          <li>GitHub</li>
          <li>Bootstrap</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’m always on the lookout for exciting new opportunities in coding,
          programming, and web development, so if you’re looking for a
          collaborative team player and innovative thinker for your team,
          connect with me here!
