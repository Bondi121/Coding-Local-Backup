Notes:

- In the Result section you can see the median value of all the categories, please provide a similar graph in the response PDF

- On the right hand side you see each question and the answer in a bar graph. Make sure these are displayed in different yellow shades, similar to the ones I 	made. 

- The results from the form responses1 tab should be automated. Please make sure all the questions in graphs are fully readable.

- Please make sure that questions can be added without messing up the formula. 

- Results of the graphics should be saved as a pdf and send as an email to the survey taker.
